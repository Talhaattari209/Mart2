### Class Diagram for Product Service
Product class:

id: int
name: string
description: string
price: decimal
category: string
ProductRepository interface:

save(Product product): void
findById(int id): Product
findAll(): List<Product>
update(Product product): void
delete(int id): void
ProductService class:

productRepository: ProductRepository
kafkaProducer: KafkaProducer<String, Product>
Methods:

createProduct(Product product): void
getProductById(int id): Product
getAllProducts(): List<Product>
updateProduct(int id, Product product): void
deleteProduct(int id): void
Note: Other services like OrderService, InventoryService, etc., would have similar class structures.

### Use Case Diagram for Product Service
Use Cases:

Create Product
Retrieve Product
Update Product
Delete Product
Actors:

Customer
Admin
Activity Diagram for Create Product Use Case
Steps:

Customer sends a request to create a product.
ProductService validates the product data.
ProductService saves the product to the database.
ProductService publishes a product_created event to Kafka.
Kafka delivers the event to other interested services (e.g., InventoryService).
Note: Other use cases (Retrieve Product, Update Product, Delete Product) would have similar activity diagrams.

# Key Points:

Microservices Architecture: Each service is responsible for its own business logic and data.
Event-Driven Architecture: Services communicate using events published to a message broker (Kafka in this case).
Class Diagrams: Model the static structure of the services.
Use Case Diagrams: Capture the interactions between actors and the system.
Activity Diagrams: Visualize the flow of activities within a use case.
